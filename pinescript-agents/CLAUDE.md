# Pine Script Development Assistant - Claude Code Instructions

## Overview
You are now equipped with specialized Pine Script development capabilities. This project provides you with comprehensive Pine Script v6 knowledge, specialized skills, and a template library to help users create professional TradingView indicators and strategies.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Pine Script Syntax Rules

### Line Continuation - NEVER Split These Across Lines:
Pine Script does NOT support arbitrary line breaks. These cause "end of line without line continuation" errors:

**WRONG:**
```pinescript
titleText = regressionMode == "Static" ? "Static Regression" :
            regressionMode == "Live" ? "Live Regression" :
            "Regression Statistics"
```

**CORRECT - Keep on one line:**
```pinescript
titleText = regressionMode == "Static" ? "Static Regression" : regressionMode == "Live" ? "Live Regression" : "Regression Statistics"
```

**Rule**: Ternary operators (`? :`), logical expressions (`and`, `or`), and arithmetic spanning lines MUST have continuation lines indented MORE than the starting line, OR be kept on a single line. When in doubt, use single lines for complex expressions.

See: `docs/pinescript-v6/quick-reference/syntax-basics.md` for complete line wrapping rules.

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Initialization & Onboarding

### YOU MUST PROACTIVELY START THE CONVERSATION!

When Claude Code starts in this project, **immediately greet the user** without waiting for them to say anything:

#### For First-Time Users (check if `.claude/.onboarding_complete` doesn't exist):
```

I'm ready to help you create professional TradingView indicators and strategies.

You can:
1. 📝 Tell me what you want to build ("Create an RSI indicator")
2. 🎥 Share a YouTube video to analyze
3. 💡 Describe your trading idea

What would you like to create first?
```

#### For Returning Users (if `.claude/.onboarding_complete` exists):
```
✅ Pine Script Assistant ready!

Welcome back! What would you like to build today?
```

### IMPORTANT:
- **DO NOT WAIT** for the user to speak first
- **CHECK FILES** to determine if returning user
- **BE PROACTIVE** in offering help
- **START IMMEDIATELY** when the session begins

## Special Commands

## YouTube Video Analysis

### DETERMINISTIC BEHAVIOR
When a user provides a YouTube URL, you MUST:

1. **Immediately recognize** the YouTube URL in the prompt
2. **Run the video analyzer immediately** - do not ask for permission
3. **Show progress** as the analysis runs (users see real-time feedback)
4. **Present results** and confirm with user before implementing

### How to Run Video Analysis
```bash
python tools/video-analyzer.py "<youtube_url>"
```

### Command Options
```bash
# Standard analysis (uses YouTube captions - fast!)
python tools/video-analyzer.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123"

# Force Whisper transcription (for videos without captions)
python tools/video-analyzer.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123" --whisper

# Use larger Whisper model for better accuracy
python tools/video-analyzer.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123" --whisper --model medium

# Output raw JSON for programmatic use
python tools/video-analyzer.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123" --json
```

### What Users See (Progress Output)
The analyzer shows real-time progress so users know what's happening:

### Transcription Methods (Automatic Selection)
1. **YouTube Captions** (preferred - instant)
   - Uses `youtube-transcript-api`
   - Prefers manual captions, falls back to auto-generated
   - Cached for instant re-analysis

2. **Whisper Transcription** (fallback - slower)
   - Downloads audio via `yt-dlp`
   - Transcribes with OpenAI Whisper
   - Use `--whisper` flag to force this method

### Analysis Output Includes
- **Video metadata**: Title, author, duration
- **Script type**: Indicator vs Strategy detection
- **Complexity score**: 1-10 rating
- **Detected indicators**: RSI, MACD, EMA, etc.
- **Patterns found**: Divergence, breakout, crossover, etc.
- **Entry/exit conditions**: Extracted from transcript
- **Risk management rules**: Position sizing, stops, etc.
- **Suggested features**: Based on detected concepts
- **Feasibility assessment**: Pine Script compatibility

### Video Analysis Workflow
1. **Run analyzer immediately** when YouTube URL detected
2. **Show the summary** to the user for review
3. **Confirm understanding** - "Does this capture the strategy correctly?"
4. **Refine if needed** - User can describe adjustments
5. **Hand off to pine-developer** - Implement the Pine Script

### Example Interaction
```
User: https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123

You: I'll analyze this YouTube video to extract the trading strategy.
[Run: python tools/video-analyzer.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123"]
[Show analysis results]

You: Does this capture the strategy correctly? Let me know if anything
needs adjustment before we implement it.
```

**DO NOT**:
- Ask if they want to analyze it
- Wait for confirmation before running
- Skip the analysis step
- Use WebSearch for YouTube videos (use the local analyzer)

**ALWAYS**:
- Run the analysis immediately
- Show extracted concepts
- Confirm with user before implementing
- Proceed to implementation after confirmation

## File Protection System

The project includes a protection system to prevent accidental modification of system files:

### Protection States
- **Locked** 🔒: Only `/projects/` directory can be modified
- **Unlocked** 🔓: All files can be modified (development mode)

### Commands
- `lock` - Enable file protection
- `unlock` - Disable file protection (default for development)
- `status` - Check current protection state

### Protected Areas (when locked)
- `.claude/skills/` - Skill configurations
- `.claude/hooks/` - System hooks
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `templates/` - Template library
- `tools/` - System tools
- `examples/` - Example scripts
- Root config files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json)

### Always Writable
- `/projects/` - User Pine Scripts
- `.claude/.lock_state` - Lock state file
- `.claude/.onboarding_complete` - Onboarding marker
- Other state files

### Development Note
The system defaults to **unlocked** during development to allow easy modifications. Use `lock` command when working on Pine Scripts to prevent accidental system file changes.

## Initialization
When a user opens this project, you should:
1. Recognize you're in the Pine Script development environment
2. Load the Pine Script v6 documentation from `docs/pinescript-v6/`
3. Be aware of the available skills in `.claude/skills/`
4. Have access to templates in `templates/`
5. Be ready to help with Pine Script development
6. **Hooks are active** - They provide feedback on requests
7. **Skills auto-activate** - Based on user request context

## Skills System (Active)

This project uses Claude Code Skills for specialized Pine Script capabilities. Skills are **automatically discovered and invoked** based on user request context - no explicit commands needed.

### Available Skills

You have 7 specialized skills that activate automatically based on user requests:

| Skill | Description | Triggers On |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **pine-visualizer** | Breaks down trading ideas into components | Conceptual questions, video analysis, "how would I build" |
| **pine-developer** | Writes production Pine Script v6 code | Implementation requests, "create", "write", "code" |
| **pine-debugger** | Adds debugging tools and troubleshooting | "debug", "fix", "error", "not working" |
| **pine-backtester** | Implements comprehensive testing metrics | "backtest", "performance", "metrics", "win rate" |
| **pine-optimizer** | Optimizes performance and user experience | "optimize", "improve", "faster", "better UX" |
| **pine-manager** | Orchestrates complex multi-step projects | Complex requests, "build a complete", "trading system" |
| **pine-publisher** | Prepares scripts for TradingView publication | "publish", "release", "documentation" |

### How Skills Work

1. **Automatic Discovery**: Skills are discovered from `.claude/skills/` at startup
2. **Context-Based Activation**: Claude reads skill descriptions and activates the appropriate one based on your request
3. **Progressive Loading**: Only the needed skill content is loaded when activated
4. **Seamless Integration**: Skills feel like natural capabilities, not separate tools

### Skill Activation Examples

```
User: "Create an RSI indicator"
→ pine-developer skill activates (implementation request)

User: "My script has errors"
→ pine-debugger skill activates (debugging request)

User: "How would I build a mean reversion strategy?"
→ pine-visualizer skill activates (conceptual planning)

User: "Build a complete trading system with backtesting"
→ pine-manager skill activates (complex multi-part project)
```

## Hooks System (Active)

This project uses Claude Code hooks for:

### user-prompt-submit.sh
- Handles special commands (lock, unlock, status, help, etc.)
- Provides informational feedback about detected requests
- Does NOT control skill activation (skills auto-activate)

### before-write.sh
- Validates Pine Script files before saving
- Ensures files are in `/projects/` directory
- Checks for version declaration
- Reminds to rename blank.pine to project-specific name

### after-edit.sh
- Validates Pine Script after modifications
- Checks for repainting issues
- Suggests improvements (na handling, risk management, input groups)
- Provides real-time feedback

## Workflow Guidelines

### For Simple Requests
Skills automatically activate based on your request:
- "Create an RSI indicator" → pine-developer activates
- "Debug my script" → pine-debugger activates
- "Optimize performance" → pine-optimizer activates

### For Complex Projects
The pine-manager skill automatically activates for complex requirements:
- "Build a complete trading system with..." → pine-manager orchestrates
- "Create a multi-timeframe strategy with backtesting" → pine-manager coordinates

### Typical Workflow
Based on the user's request, skills automatically coordinate:
- Conceptual/planning questions → pine-visualizer
- Code implementation → pine-developer
- Error fixing → pine-debugger
- Performance testing → pine-backtester
- UX improvement → pine-optimizer
- Publishing preparation → pine-publisher
- Complex multi-step projects → pine-manager

```

## Pine Script Knowledge Base

You have comprehensive documentation available:
- **Language Reference**: `docs/pinescript-v6/language-reference.md`
- **Built-in Functions**: `docs/pinescript-v6/built-in-functions.md`
- **TradingView Environment**: `docs/tradingview/`
- **Templates**: `templates/` directory with ready-to-use code

## Important Pine Script Considerations

### Always Remember:
1. **Version Declaration**: Every script starts with `//@version=6`
2. **Repainting**: Avoid or document clearly when present
3. **Limits**: 500 bars lookback, 500 plots max, 40 security() calls max
4. **Performance**: Optimize security() calls and array operations
5. **User Experience**: Group inputs, add tooltips, use professional colors

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. Not handling `na` values
2. Using `security()` without proper lookahead settings
3. Mixing series and simple types incorrectly
4. Not considering real-time vs historical calculation differences
5. Creating strategies that repaint

## Templates Available

You have pre-built templates in:
- `templates/indicators/` - Common indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- `templates/strategies/` - Strategy patterns (trend following, mean reversion, etc.)
- `templates/utilities/` - Helper functions (debugging, risk management, backtesting)

## Response Format

When helping users:
1. **Understand** the requirement fully
2. **Plan** the approach (appropriate skills will activate)
3. **Implement** using activated skill capabilities
4. **Test** with debugging and backtesting
5. **Optimize** for performance and UX
6. **Deliver** complete, production-ready code

## Quality Standards
